The account_fr_chorus module allows to send invoices through the `Chorus Pro
<https://chorus-pro.gouv.fr/>`_ portal.

If the party is checked for Chorus Pro, all posted customer invoices are queued
to be sent.  A cron job will send them every 15 minutes by default using the
credential from the accounting configuration.
