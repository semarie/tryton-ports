The SMS authentication module allows to authenticate users via SMS.
There are two authentication methods `sms` and `password_sms` which
can be used in the `authentications` list of the `session` section
in the configuration.

The `sms` method just send a code via SMS to the user. Then the
user needs to transcribe the code into the login dialog.

The `password_sms` method send a code only after the user entered
a valid password. This provides a two-factor authentication method.

Both methods require that the user has a *Mobile* phone number
defined otherwise he can not be authenticated with those methods.

Note that the module requires additional configuration and function
(python module) to have an effective way to send SMS code.
