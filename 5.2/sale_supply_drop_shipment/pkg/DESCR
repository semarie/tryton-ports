The Sale Supply Drop Shipment module adds a drop shipment option on product
supplier if "supply on request" is checked. When checked, the purchase request
and the linked purchase have the address of customer as Delivery Address;
at the confirmation of the purchase a drop shipment is created and linked to
both the purchase and the sale.
