The account_statement_rule module allows rules to be defined to complete
statement lines from imported files.

When the "Apply Rule" button is clicked on a statement, each rule is tested in
order against each origin that does not have any lines until one is found that
matches. Then the rule found is used to create the statement lines linked to
the origin.
